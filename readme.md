# WebKit iFrame COEP Disk Cache bug

This bug might manifest in other scenario's as well, but I found it when embedding iframes.

You can follow along by cloning this repository, installing the dependencies and running the `start` command. The website will be hosted on http://localhost:3000.

```
npm install && npm start
```

## Scenario

A page which defines `COEP: require-corp` wants to embed an iframe. The iframe specifices `CORP: cross-origin`.

This works because the iframe indicates the `CORP: cross-origin` header. For this test it could've been `same-origin` as well because they are hosted on the same domain, but in my real-world use cases these are different domains.

## Issue

When refreshing the page, everything still works. Closing the browser window with the red `X` in the top left, re-opening it and opening the web page again also works. This is probably due to the fact that the `iframe.html` resource is then loaded from `Memory Cache`, and not from `Disk `Cache`.

However, when quitting the browser entirely with <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> <kbd>Q</kbd>, re-opening it and opening the web page again, breaks. The iframe will not be loaded.

When taking a closer look to the devtools we see the error

> Refused to display '' in a frame because of Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy.

Refreshing the page with DevTools open sometimes fixes the issue. But it seems to only fix it if the `iframe.html` resources is loaded from `Memory Cache`. In the scenario where it's loaded from `Disk Cache`, it seems that the `CORP` header from the resource is not taken into account. This is probably the reason why the behaviour is different when quitting Safari entirely.
